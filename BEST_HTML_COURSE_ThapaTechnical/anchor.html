<!-- *------------------------------------- -->
<!--* INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: HTML ANCHOR TAG  
<!-- *---------------------------------------- -->

<!--* 1: How can you create a link within the same webpage that takes the user to a specific section or element on the page? -->
<!-- To create a link that takes the user to a specific section or element within the
same webpage, you can use the anchor (a) tag's href attribute along with the id attribute of the target element. -->

<!--* 2: What's the difference between relative and absolute URLs in the href attribute? -->
<!--? Relative URLs are URLs that are relative to the current page's URL.    Absolute URLs are complete URLs, including the protocol (http/https) and domain. -->

<!--* 3: How does the download attribute work in the anchor tag? -->
<!-- The download attribute suggests that the linked resource should be downloaded instead of navigated to, prompting the user to download the file. -->

<!--* 4: How do you create an HTML link that opens the user's default email client with a specific email address? -->

<a href="mailto:thapa@technical.com">Send email to thapa</a>

<!--* 5: How can you create a clickable link in HTML that allows users to directly initiate a phone call when clicked? -->
To create a link that enables users to initiate a phone call when clicked, you
can use the anchor tag's href attribute with the tel: protocol.

<a href="tel:+1234567890">Call Us</a>

<!-- *------------------------------------- -->
<!--* BONUS: HTML ANCHOR TAG  
<!-- *---------------------------------------- -->

<!--* ALSO WHEN TO USE QUOTES, WHEN NOT TO  -->

✅ <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>

❌ <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>

<!-- So the best practice is Always include the attribute quotes. It avoids such problems, and results in more readable code. -->

<!--* Single or double quotes?  -->
 <a href='https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>

<a href="https://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a> 

<!--! mixing both the quotes at the same time is wrong -->
<!-- ❌ <a href="https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a> -->

<!--? However, if you use one type of quote, you can include the other type of quote inside your attribute values: -->
 <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Isn&quot;t this fun?">
  A link to my &lt; fsdf &gt; example.
</a>
